            Josh began playing the trumpet when he was in third grade. He became skilled with the trumpet,<br>
            continuing with his musical stylings&nbsp;through high school where he was first chair and regular<br>
            soloist on the&nbsp;marching field. In college Josh studied music and picked up the guitar.&nbsp;He was<br>
            primarily self-taught on the guitar, although he received help from&nbsp;his many musical relatives,<br>
            especially his Uncle Mike. Josh went on to found&nbsp;several bands while living in central Florida.<br>
            He recorded two cds and was&nbsp;played on the local radio stations. Josh also played in many<br>
            venues including the Sun&nbsp;cruise casino ship and the Battle of the Bands. His career took a<br>
            different&nbsp;turn when he moved to Virginia. Leaving his band behind, Josh played at the GE Pig<br>
            roast&nbsp;several years and performed solo at Mill Mountain coffee shop and the 4th Street coffee<br>
            &nbsp;shop. Josh started singing with Maria in the fall of 2011. They fell in love and were married<br>
            in July of 2012. Vive l’amore!</p>

                <p>Maria started her singing career at the age of 4 when she performed at the JaMar Rec<br>
                  Center in St. Petersburg, Florida. Maria continued adding to her musical repertoire<br>
                  by learning piano, alto saxophone, tenor saxophone, bassoon, and marching tenors.<br>
                  She earned a minor in voice at Roanoke College and did a variety of chorus, musical theatre,<br>
                  and solo performances while teaching in the Roanoke County Schools. Although classically<br>
                  trained, Maria loves singing rock and Christian music with Josh, and hopes to add bass<br>
                  guitar to her list of instruments soon. Josh is the most wonderful husband and is the driving<br>
                  force for the couple; Maria is a fabulous wife and is the organization behind the duo.</p>
